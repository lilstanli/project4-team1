Process
    Extract and redefine the target labels from the records dataset
        research and use researched formular to convert catagical data to binary classified labels for training purposes
    
    Reshape the features dataset creating vectors out of the features.
        Convert all categorical data to numerical values to establish relationships whiles expanding the features
        Plot graphs to check balance of dataset and to find out which values should 
        
 
    Append the target labels to the features dataset
    
    Train the dataset
        Optimize the training data  for better accuracy where possible
            - Use a hyperparameter tuning method to get the right optimization parameters where possible
    
    Test the trained dataset ising an unknown test data that has no labels
